# Comprehensive Vulnerability Assessment Report

## 1. Introduction
This report presents the findings, analysis, and remediation guidance for two critical security issues discovered during the recent assessment of the target web application:

1. **SQL Injection** in the login form.
2. **Local File Inclusion (LFI)** in the file upload feature.

These vulnerabilities pose significant risks, including unauthorized data access, complete system compromise, and reputational damage. This document details the technical background, potential impact, and recommended fixes.

---

## 2. Executive Summary
- **SQL Injection**: The login form fails to properly separate user input from SQL commands, allowing attackers to manipulate queries and bypass authentication or extract sensitive data.
- **Local File Inclusion**: The file upload endpoint allows user-supplied paths to be included within server-side scripts, enabling access to arbitrary files and potential remote code execution.

Both issues stem from inadequate input validation and unsafe coding practices. Immediate remediation is required to protect user data and maintain application integrity.

---

## 3. Scope and Methodology
- **Scope**: Internal penetration test of the authentication and file handling modules.
- **Methodology**:
  - Manual code review of login and file upload handlers.
  - Automated scanning tools (e.g., Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP).
  - Proof-of-Concept (PoC) exploitation to validate impact.
  - Cross-referencing OWASP guidelines and industry best practices.

## 4. Vulnerability 1: SQL Injection in the Login Form

### 4.1 Description
SQL Injection (SQLi) occurs when untrusted input is concatenated directly into a SQL statement. In the login endpoint, the `username` and `password` parameters are inserted into a query without proper sanitization or parameterization.

### 4.2 Technical Background
- **Affected Code Snippet (PHP example)**:
  ```php
  $query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '" . $_POST['username'] . "' AND password = '" . $_POST['password'] . "'";
  $result = mysqli_query($conn, $query);
  ```
- **Issue**: Attackers can inject payloads like `' OR '1'='1` to manipulate the `WHERE` clause.

### 4.3 Potential Impact
- Authentication bypass.
- Data exfiltration (e.g., reading the `users` table or other tables).
- Full database compromise leading to data loss, service disruption, and compliance violations.

### 4.4 Proof of Concept
1. Submit the following credentials:
   - **Username**: `admin' -- `
   - **Password**: (any)
2. The resulting query becomes:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'admin' -- ' AND password = '';
   ```
3. The `--` comments out the password check, granting access.

### 4.5 Remediation Recommendations
1. **Use Parameterized Queries / Prepared Statements**:
   ```php
   $stmt = $conn->prepare("SELECT id FROM users WHERE username = ? AND password = ?");
   $stmt->bind_param("ss", $_POST['username'], $_POST['password']);
   $stmt->execute();
   ```
2. **Implement Strong Input Validation**:
   - Enforce allowed character sets (e.g., alphanumeric plus limited symbols).
   - Enforce maximum length limits.
3. **Hash and Salt Passwords**:
   - Use `password_hash()` and `password_verify()` in PHP.
4. **Least Privilege**:
   - Ensure the database user can only execute necessary `SELECT` statements.
5. **Error Handling**:
   - Return generic error messages (`"Invalid credentials"`) and log detailed errors internally.
6. **WAF and Monitoring**:
   - Deploy a Web Application Firewall with SQLi rules.

## 5. Vulnerability 2: Local File Inclusion in the File Upload Feature

### 5.1 Description
Local File Inclusion (LFI) arises when user input is used to determine which server file to load, without proper validation. The application’s upload handler accepts a `filePath` parameter and directly passes it to `include()`.

### 5.2 Technical Background
- **Affected Code Snippet (PHP example)**:
  ```php
  $file = $_GET['filePath'];
  include("uploads/" . $file);
  ```
- **Issue**: An attacker can submit `../../../etc/passwd` to read system files or upload malicious PHP scripts.

### 5.3 Potential Impact
- Disclosure of sensitive files (configuration, credentials).
- Remote Code Execution (RCE) by uploading a web shell.
- Full server compromise.

### 5.4 Proof of Concept
1. Access URL: `https://app.example.com/upload?filePath=../../../../etc/passwd`
2. The response shows the contents of `/etc/passwd`, confirming read access.
3. By uploading a PHP shell (e.g., `shell.php`) and calling `filePath=shell.php`, remote code execution is achieved.

### 5.5 Remediation Recommendations
1. **Whitelist Valid Files**:
   ```php
   $allowed = ['image1.jpg', 'report.pdf'];
   if (!in_array($_GET['filePath'], $allowed)) {
       exit('Invalid file');
   }
   include(__DIR__ . '/uploads/' . $_GET['filePath']);
   ```
2. **Use `realpath()` and Validate Directory**:
   ```php
   $path = realpath(__DIR__ . '/uploads/' . $_GET['filePath']);
   if (strpos($path, __DIR__ . '/uploads/') !== 0) {
       exit('Access denied');
   }
   include($path);
   ```
3. **Store Uploads Outside the Web Root** and serve via a controlled script.
4. **Rename and Sanitize Filenames**:
   - Generate UUIDs or hash-based names.
   - Strip directory separators and invalid characters.
5. **Disable PHP Execution** in the upload directory (`chmod 0644`, `Options -ExecCGI`).
6. **Antivirus / Malware Scanning** on upload.
7. **Logging and Alerting** for unexpected inclusion attempts.

## 6. General Mitigation Strategies

### 6.1 Secure Coding Best Practices
- Adhere to OWASP Top 10 and secure coding standards.
- Conduct peer code reviews focusing on input handling.
- Utilize security linters and static analysis tools.

### 6.2 Web Application Firewall (WAF) and Monitoring
- Deploy a WAF with tuned rules for SQLi and LFI patterns.
- Monitor logs for suspicious parameters and high-volume requests.
- Alert on repeated 400/500 errors and unusual file-access patterns.

### 6.3 Regular Testing and Audits
- Schedule periodic penetration tests and automated scans.
- Integrate security testing into CI/CD pipelines.
- Update third-party libraries and frameworks promptly.

## 7. Conclusion
The identified SQL Injection and Local File Inclusion vulnerabilities represent critical weaknesses in the application’s input handling and file management processes. By implementing the recommended remediations—parameterized queries, strict file whitelisting, path normalization, and robust monitoring—the risk can be substantially mitigated. Adopting a defense-in-depth approach, including secure coding practices, WAF protection, and continuous testing, will strengthen the overall security posture and help prevent similar issues in the future.
